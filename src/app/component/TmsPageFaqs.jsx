        rTMS treatments have been performed with virtually no complications or side effects.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most commonly reported side effect related to treatment was mild to moderate scalp discomfort during treatment sessions. Scalp discomfort occurs less frequently after the first week of treatment.

        rTMS therapy also produces a clicking sound, so earplugs are provided for each treatment.

        In clinical trials, more than 10,000 rTMS treatments demonstrated its safety with no occurrence of seizures. However, there is a small risk of a seizure occurring during treatment, estimated at 1 in 10,000. This risk is no greater than what has been observed with oral antidepressant medications.

        During a rTMS treatment session, you will sit comfortably in a reclined treatment chair with your head supported in a relaxed position. The magnetic coil is typically placed on the left front side of your head, targeting an area of the brain known as the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC).
    </p>
    <p>
        Here’s what happens during the session:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span className="font-bold">Magnetic Pulses:</span> The treatment coil sends bursts of magnetic pulses through your scalp. These pulses create small electric currents in the targeted area of your brain. You won’t feel these currents, similar to how wireless charging works for your phone.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span className="font-bold">Nerve Activation:</span> These electric currents activate nerve cells in the DLPFC. This activation helps stimulate neural pathways and promotes communication between different brain regions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span className="font-bold">Neuroplasticity:</span> With repeated treatments, rTMS encourages the brain to reorganize and form new neural connections, a process known as neuroplasticity. This helps normalize brain activity and restore it to its optimal functioning before the onset of your condition.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, rTMS is a non-invasive and comfortable procedure designed to support your brain's natural ability to heal and improve your mental well-being.

        <span className="font-bold">Initial Response:</span> Many patients begin to notice improvements in their symptoms within the first few weeks of starting rTMS treatment. These early changes can include reduced feelings of depression, anxiety, or other targeted symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span className="font-bold">End of Treatment Course:</span> By the end of a typical 6-week rTMS treatment course, most individuals experience significant symptom relief, with lasting effects that extend several weeks beyond the completion of therapy.

    <p>
        <span className="font-bold">Sustained Improvement:</span> Studies have shown that the positive effects of rTMS can last anywhere from 6 months to a year post-treatment. Approximately 60% of patients maintain their symptom relief for several months after the initial treatment course.

        <span className="font-bold">Extended Remission:</span> For some individuals, the benefits can extend even longer, especially when combined with other forms of therapy such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or medication management.

    <p>

        <span className="font-bold">No Need for Medication:</span> rTMS does not require the use of sedatives or muscle relaxants, reducing the complexity and preparation involved in the procedure.

        <span className="font-bold">Less Physical Discomfort:</span> rTMS may cause mild scalp discomfort or headache during treatment sessions, but these side effects are typically transient and far less severe than the side effects associated with ECT.

    <p>
        <span className="font-bold">Lower Risk of Physical Complications:</span> ECT carries risks such as cardiovascular complications and requires careful medical supervision. rTMS has a much safer profile with fewer physical health risks, making it suitable for a broader range of patients.
